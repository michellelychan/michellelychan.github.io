					<h2>ABOUT THE STARTUP</h2>
					<p>I founded Weava, a research tool for students to highlight, organize, and create their research documents all in one place.  Together with our team, we designed, monetized, and scaled the productivity tool to half a million registered users from 200+ educational institutions in 50+ countries, and gained thousands of  happy paying schools, teachers, and students. I later exited the company to one of my investors who is currently running the company with his team to further accelerate user adoption in schools.</p>

					<p>Weava was featured in Lifehacker.jp, Australian technology magazine TechLife, TekCrispy, and in schools from Alibama's Madison City Schools' website to Harvard University Cabot Science Library. It was also selected as #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt and in the top featured banner of Google's Chrome App Store. </p>

				<h2>Users & Featured Stories</h2>

				<p>I paid a visit to schools using Weava from school districts in Alabama to Harvard University, and had video chats with hundred of users to learn more about how they use our product.  Students and researchers from around the world use Weava for research. Here are some of the educational institutions using us: </p>

				<h2>User Retention</h2>

				<p>One of the things that we achieved is maintaining a <b>24% weekly retention</b> and <b>20% daily retention</b> that plateaus pretty early along the user journey. This means that if the user signs up for our app and creates their 1st highlight in user onboarding, on average 24% will come back weekly and 20% will come back daily. This excludes times during summer or winter when students do not have to go to school. The screenshots below are taken from Amplitude, a daily analytics tool we used back then. </p>

					<h2>User Problem</h2>
					<p>When it comes to research for writing papers, it is often a messy and painful process. You have to: </p>
					<p>1. Open a lot of browser tabs to find what you want</p>
					<p>2. Manually copy and paste relevant information into a long research document </p>
					<p>3. Filter through the research document for insights and take notes </p>
					<p>4. Copy the author, url, and date for citations</p>
