				<h2>The Product</h2>
				
				<p>Kara Smart Fitness mirror is the first smart fitness mirror in Hong Kong and Australia. It uses AI and computer vision to track your key body moments and provides you with relevant course recommendations based on your performance.</p>

				<p>While our smart fitness mirror is similar to those of Mirror.com, Tempo, and other competitors and open to male and female users, the most prominent user persona in our group is female aged 25 - 55 who may often skip the gym due to family, Covidy, busy schedules, and other reasons.  We also provide a mobile app with our workout courses and is featured several times on Apple App Store. </p>

				<p>Mirrors offer an interesting their interface to your ambient environment. It is fun to play with different types of human interactions with large screens and computer vision. </p>

					<h2>Impact</h2>

					<p>Throughout my time at the company, I helped them set up their data analysis tracking with Amplitude, building core metrics & dashboards, and helped improve the number of weekly paid mirrors by 3x through working on user acquisition (website landing page, partnering with ads agendy on marketing ad videos). I also created a type of AI fitness workout games that improved user engagement by 15% and resulted in, together with the sales' teams efforts, in sales partnerships such as HKBN. </p>

					<h2>From attracting mall passersby to creating AI interactive fitness games</h2>

					<img alt="How Runscope Team uses Mission Control" class="margin-top-bottom-10" src="../static/img/mirror_mall_photos.jpg">

					<p>One of our major sales channel other than online marketing is through offline stores and partnerships with malls, hotels, corporate gyms, and more. However, users find it hard to spot anything special about the mirror when they are passing by. Therefore, we introduced a catchy screensaver that brings users to a 3 min AI fitness workout challenge that measures the users performance, compares their performance with other users, and provides them with workout recommendations. Through just 3 mins, users can experience the benefit of the mirror.  </p>

					<p>We realized that this was a very popular game, and the demo also attracted more sales partnerships. We decided to incorporate a similar type of content into our core consumer mirror product, where users can play an AI interactive fitness game that provides them with workout recommendations. One of the user problems is that users are not sure about their fitness level and the courses that fit. With the AI interactive game, we can measure their performance through cardio and strength exercises and provide them with workout recommenations based on their strength, balance, and cardiovascular fitness. </p>

					<h2>Customer acquisition - website redesign</h2>

					<p>Like many e-commerce stores, the core reason a user buys a product is due to its website and ads. Therefore, for one month we focused entirely on user acquisition, of which we revamped the website to make the product more. For the website design and copy, we focused more on the target audience of female mothers as that has been a dominant user base for us. These are some major changes that we did: </p>

					<h4>1. ARTICULATE PRODUCT VALUE</h4>

					<p>It is not just a mirror and some courses.  The mirror turns your home into a versatile gym, a boxing studio, a yoga sanctuary, a cardio playground, and much more. For busy mothers, nothing is as convenient and comfortable as working out at home and as fun as working out together as a family. With computer vision, the mirror can also assess your performance and provide you with recommended workouts. We also emphasized on our workout variety for all levels of fitness. </p>

					<h4>2. REMOVE FRICTION AND CREATE TRUST</h4>

					<p>Frictions play a huge role in preventing users from buying, especially for a HK$12,500 mirror. We made the purchase process as low risk and friction as possible, providing options for monthly payments, 30-day risk free trials, live demos, and in-person delivery & installation.  Also, user testimonials, one-year warranty, and customer logos all help to create trust.</p>
